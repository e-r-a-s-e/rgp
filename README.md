# RGP -- Retro Game Pass
This is a program that allows you to play retro games without needing to store the rom.

# Requirements
Depending on the console you want to play, you will need different things (aka, a different emulator). Here is what you should install if you want specific consoles

- NES: [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/home.html)
- GBA: [mgba](https://mgba.io)

All installs of RGP require `dialog`, `bash` and `wget`. Programs can be installed through your distro's package manager or through [brew](https://brew.sh) on macOS. This program does not support Windows.

*__IMPORTANT__*
You will need a link that follows the program's file names (the roms need to have specific file names) You can find what the file names must be [here](FILENAMES.md). Contact [me](https://github.com/e-r-a-s-e/) if you need the default Internet Archive link. (It works well as the roms are small)

# How to run
type `bash main.sh` in the root of the folder
